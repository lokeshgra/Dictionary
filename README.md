# Dictionary
## C++ Implementation of Decision Tree Algorithm


#Data Structure and Algorithms used in Project
Trie Data Structure is used for storing words of dictionary that find a word in dictionary in O(size of Word) time complexity
so it give fast result to user

##Levenshtein Distance:-
if word is not found in Dictionary then I used levenshtein distance to find similiar word using calculating Distance
b/w Words and Giving 10 similiar words to user
So in Levenshtein Distance Algorithms change word 1 to 10 Distance

#About input file
Dictionary JSON file is used that contain 32000 words and Definations of words
File size 21.7MB

# Summary of the Project
All words are stored in Trie.
we'll give a word as a input and receive definations of that word as a output
if word is not found in dictionary then Dictionary will Suggest 10 word
to user
